See em hate on my success
It never surprise me
If you got a problem
Homie, you know where to find me
Tryna inspire my people
But you take it as a diss
Follow my every move
And I'll never know you exist
Vette parked in the garage
I could see through the façade
I'm coming up
I'm going hard
I am a legend
I'm a god
You could be like me
We from the same city
Instead you spite me
Bitch made and grimey
They envy me
323 MVP
Louden beast on the beats
We the talk of the streets
Always make time in my day to shit on all my haters
Got a bag full of lifesavers, all different flavors
Chillen on a yacht
Bitch, I stay wavy
Bitch, I stay crazy
Fuck you, pay me
Me, I tell the truth, even when I lie
I'm Scarface
No heartache
Read in between the lines

Live the life of a thug until the day I die
Live the life of a boss
All eyez on me
Live the life of a thug until the day I die
Live the life of a boss
All eyez on me
All eyez on me
Tell em all eyez on me
All eyez on me
Yeah

Got the world on my shoulders
Check mate
Hold up
High, I'm never sober
Cruisin' in my rover
Bitch!
Never question
Not scared of tension
You sick with an obsession
All up in my mentions
Blessings
God's gift to earth
I'm a legend
I cry tears of gold underneath my Gucci lenses
This ain't rented
No pretending
We gon get it
I could spend it
No more limits
I stay shitting on you bitches
I'm official
Game over
Bitch, blow the whistle
I'm an OG
Bitch, you still smoking crystal
You like a juvenile stuck in a cage
Turned into a man imprisoned in a box
Insane
Obsessing over vengeance
One day you'll escape
But you could never kill me
The whole city know my name
Homies pull up in the whip
Hit the line
They come equipped
You used to be from the click
Then you switched
You make me sick
Snakes in the grass
Everyone not gon be forever
Didn't notice your absence
I barely feel the difference
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money, mothafucka
Let's get rich and we'll kick it

Live the life of a thug until the day I die
Live the life of a boss
All eyez on me
Live the life of a thug until the day I die
Live the life of a boss
All eyez on me
All eyez on me
Tell em all eyez on me
All eyez on me
Yeah
